		<h1>About Me</h1>
	</center>

	<div class="half">
		<p><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a student at Calvin College studying Computer Science and Mandarin Chinese. While at college, I've worked on a number of different projects, most of which are showcased on this website. This website was initally created for CAS 180 at Calvin College to showcase projects I made for that class, but is also used to display my other projects that are more relevant to Computer Science.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I grew up in Uganda, California and India as a missionary kid, which has helped me to relate to people from various cultures. I am passionate about CS and China and hoping to eventually combine the two. I enjoy working on various CS projects, biking, reading and learning about various cultures around the world.</p>
