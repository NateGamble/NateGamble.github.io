		<h1>Photoshop Collage</h1>
		<p>This assignment was completed for CAS 180 at Calvin College. This collage is made of 7 individual pictures of varying sizes. Four of these pictures were taken by me, and the remaining three are taken from the web. I chose to go with a Star Wars theme for my collage, both trying to recreate iconic scenes and twist other scenes. I chose to have a wide variety of color to show how varied the Star Wars universe is. I used the clone stamp tool to remove a table and chairs from one picture, and General Grievous' lightsabers from another picture.</p>
