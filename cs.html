		<h2><a href="https://nategamble.github.io">This Website</a></h2>
	</center>
	<p>This website was initially created as part of a project for CAS 180 at Calvin College. The Communication with Ditigal Media class required all students to have a website that showed off their projects from the class. I took on the assignment and created my own website from scratch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This website uses Github to host the website as well as lots of help from resources on the internet.</p><br>

		<h2><a href="https://github.com/Calvin-CS262">CalUber</a></h2>
	</center>
	<p>CalUber is an app that I worked on with a group for a Software Engineering class at Calvin College. We created an Android app with the intent to increase carpooling on campus. Users of our app could input where they were going, when they were going and how many people they were willing to take with them. These rides were stored in an SQL database hosted on Google Cloud. Users could also search these rides and join rides to destinations they wanted to go.</p><br>

		<h2><a href="https://github.com/NateGamble/PythonBackgammon">Backgammon</a></h2>
	</center>
	<p>This GUI Backgammon game was the final project for my Python CS class. We were tasked with making a game with a GUI in python, and I decided to make Backgammon. The player is always white (and goes first), while the computer is always black. The player can roll the dice, choose the piece they wish to move and choose where they wish to move it. The computer player picks a random valid move, making the game very easy to win. This project may be revisited to add multiple difficulties of AI opponents, add a multiplayer mode and/or randomly assign colors to players instead of it being static.</p>
	<p>If you would like to download the .exe version of my project, download this <a href="https://github.com/NateGamble/PythonBackgammon/archive/master.zip">zipped file</a>, and run gui.exe in the exe folder.</p><br>

		<h2><a href="https://github.com/NateGamble/CS212Fall2019/tree/master/Project05">Mancala AI</a></h2>
	</center>
	<p>A year after I made the Backgammon game, I learned how to make traditional AIs and made one for a project in Data Structures and Algorithm class at Calvin College. The professor provided the Mancala game, all we had to do was to design the AI that would play the game with a minimax algorithm. I decided to add alpha-beta pruning to my AI, and researched some heuristics that were commonly used in Mancala AIs.</p>
