		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p><br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project comes from Petram Design International, a engineering missionary organization with offices around the world. Petram is currently measuring these offices with various metrics like how many hours projects were worked on in a given month, how much income was generated from those projects, and more. The problem is that Petram is currently tracking these metrics through 3 different programs. Petram asked me to create simpler way to view all of the data in one digital location.</p>
		<br><br>
		<h2>Solution</h2>
		<p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p><br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I designed a website and database that work together to store and present these metrics to the user. The website uses Php to access the database, and Javascript to display a graphical interface for the user to interact with. The database was designed to hold all relevant information relating to the metrics that Petram uses, while the website was created to be a simple UI with a large focus on the graphical representation of the data, as seen in the picture to the right.</p><br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data was meant to be uploaded to the website by Petram once a month to track the metrics. All data would be held for 12 months so as to compare current data to previous months. This data would be used to look at trends in offices and anticipate problems that could arise.</p>
